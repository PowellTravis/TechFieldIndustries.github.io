        <h3>Trav P: Launch Day Welcome!</h3>
        <p> Hello Everyone from the Owner of this website! I am proud to announce that this section of the website is finally launched and
          situated properly. I wanted to go and just put it out there that I have been the only one on development so far because of
          timing and other factors so I am sorry for it taking so long for this to come out. I am wanting to get others with us on the
          team and at least having some more people working withoutme on the site. I know I sound so wanting but I have had a hard time
          doing all of the development by my self. I also have been recording parts of the development on this website so I will be
        posting some of the development on our website. </p>
