  <h4>Trav P : CEO/Owner/Developer</h4> I am one of the main developers and the owher of this server. I wanted to make a nice way to make my Ideas get put out there without having to do a blog or any thing else. I also wanted to have a way of not bumbarding everyone with emails from an email
  list. But more about me I love to do little expirments with code and see how I can make this website better in any way. I mainly do HTML5 and CSS3 but other than that I do not do much. I want to get into other types of code but do not know how I should
  aproach them. I am thinking about while on summer break I do some coding classed but still have to find the right one to go to. But other than that I have some really good people that help me out on a regular basis But more about me I love to do little

  on summer break I do some coding classes, but still have to find the right one to go to. But other than that I have some really good people that help me out on a regular basis that advise me on what to do and what is best for the good of the website.
  I do not think that if I did not have the people that I have I would not be here in the first place. I also have random free time developments <a href="/Travis Random Developments/index.html"> -->Here<--</a>
